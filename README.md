Code examples and utilities for the RSA API and USB-based RSA300/500/600 instruments

To use these code examples, download and install the most recent version of the RSA API. As of this writing, the most recent version is 3.11.0047 and can be downloaded here: https://www.tek.com/model/rsa306-software/rsa-application-programming-interface-api-64-bit-windows-v3110047. Download the accompanying documentation for the API as well.

======================================================
https://github.com/tektronix/RSA_API/ for C# write on C++/cli. 
My implementation use p\invoke.

Install USB 3.0 Driver WIN8.zip or  RSA API and USB Driver
After cloning, extract {x86,x64}.7z  to TektronixRSA/{x86,x64}

Recommend build x64 for SIMD acceleration.
